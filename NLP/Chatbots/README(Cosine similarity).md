# Chatbot Cosine Similarity Project
## Overview
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of cosine similarity, likely for use in a chatbot system. Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two documents or vectors are, irrespective of their magnitude. Itâ€™s commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) for comparing text data

## Dataset
The link to the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/comprehensive-medical-q-a-dataset.
The notebook uses the Comprehensive Medical Q&A Dataset from Kaggle, which contains a large collection of medical question-and-answer pairs. The dataset is ideal for tasks like building question-answering systems and medical chatbots. It covers various medical topics such as conditions, treatments, symptoms, and procedures.
